<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Minion Maze is an exciting puzzle game set in a first-person 3D environment. You take on the role of a minion equipped with a hammer and your only motivation is to find the end of the maze filled with bananas. As you explore the maze, you can collect coins and other power-ups. But the real challenge lies in the walls that block your way to the end. Some walls are made of metal, while others are made of wood that can be broken down with your hammer. As you make your way through the maze, you can find alternative paths that lead you closer to your goal. With strategic use of your hammer, you can find more efficient ways of getting to the finish and uncover surprise rewards. Test your skills as you increase the difficulty with each level and show off your skills as you reach the end.
